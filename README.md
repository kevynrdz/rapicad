# RAPICAD | An Easy-To-Use database of parametric CAD files for FreeCAD.
## About the project
RAPICAD is a database with parametric CAD files of standard fasteners, structural members, COTS and any product that should you buy for your proyects.

All files are made with open-source software.
When I started designing there weren't many known open-source software options for CAD. Until now there was no open library of 3D models of fasteners and standard components made with free software.

RAPICAD seeks to speed up the design process providing CAD models of standardized parts, materials and parametric models according to the corresponding international regulations so that both professionals and beginners can develop their projects in an easier way.

## How to use
